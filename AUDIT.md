# Data-integrity audit

Running record of defects found while working on estimates, billing and dispatch.
Each entry states what was wrong, the evidence, the real-world exposure, and status.

Diagnostic scripts referenced below live in `scripts/` and are **read-only** unless
explicitly stated. Run them against the dev server with the app loaded and signed in.

## OPEN

### O1. GP lookup can match the wrong transformer — highest severity

`NewJob.tsx:261-268` loads `pastJobs` with `where('ownerId', '==', uid)` only — **no
agency filter, no AT filter** — then sorts `createdAt` descending. The lookup at
`NewJob.tsx:1372` is `pastJobs.find(j => j.jobNo.toUpperCase() === val)`, so it takes
the **most recently created** job carrying that number, which need not be the unit on
the bench and need not even be in the same agency.

`applyPastJobToRow` (`NewJob.tsx:340-362`) then overwrites the row's `capacityKva`,
`make`, `serialNo`, `coreType`, `starRating`, `prevJobNo`, `prevAtNo` and
`prevDeliveryDate` from that record. `prevDeliveryDate` is what `calculateGpWarranty`
measures the window from.

**Exposure:** a guarantee claim assessed against another transformer's repair history —
wrong expiry date, wrong in/out-of-warranty verdict, and the row's serial number
silently replaced. Triggers on typing an exact number, not only on picking from the
datalist. Severity depends on the duplicate count — see O2.

### O2. Job numbers are not uniquely allocated

**This corrects an earlier conclusion that the race was fixed because `runTransaction`
was present.** It is not. The transaction at `NewJob.tsx:858` *reconciles a counter*;
it does not *allocate a unique number*. The number is chosen client-side before the
transaction opens, by `getNextJobNoInfo` (`AgencyContext.tsx:663`) reading
`activeAtMaster.lastJobNumbers` from in-memory state. Inside the transaction, lines
957-963 only raise `lastJobNumbers[counterKey]` to the maximum number already used —
nothing checks whether that number is taken.

Four collision paths:

1. **Concurrent intake** — two tabs/users read the same counter, compute the same
   number, both save. No conflict is raised.
2. **Stale context** — `syncCountersState` updates local state only in the saving tab.
3. **Core type / division changed after allocation** — `counterKey` changes, so the
   number is drawn from one counter and reconciled into another; the original counter
   never advances and reissues it.
4. **Different AT master — STRUCTURAL, not a race.** Counters live on
   `activeAtMaster.lastJobNumbers`, but prefixes come from shared division config. Two
   AT masters under one agency have independent counters, so the same
   division + core type produces the same job number under each. Guaranteed to recur
   on every new AT master. Needs a decision about *where counters live*, not a lock.

Not a defect: a GP warranty repair deliberately reuses the original job number
(`NewJob.tsx:890-891, 940`). Same physical unit, second visit. Distinguished from a
true collision by serial number.

**Diagnostic:** `scripts/duplicate-jobno-console.js` — separates legitimate GP repeats
from true collisions and shows which record the GP lookup would return for each.

### O3. Per-job `billAmount` applies AT twice

`BillingSystem.calculateJobTotal` already returns an AT-inclusive figure, then
`handleConfirmSendBill` multiplies by `(1 + atPct/100)` again before GST.

**Exposure:** the *printed* bill is correct (it uses `subTotal`/`grandTotal`, single
AT); only the `billAmount` stored on each job document is inflated. Anything reading
that field for reporting or reconciliation reads high. Not yet fixed — pending a
decision, since it is a bill-calculation change.

## FIXED

### F1. Estimates priced off capacity defaults, not inspection data

`EstimateGenerate.tsx` queried `inspections` with `where('agencyId', '==', ...)`, but
**no inspection save path has ever written `agencyId`**. Firestore excludes documents
lacking the field, so the query returned zero rows for every job, always. With
`externalData`/`internalData` undefined, every optional-chained read in
`buildSingleJobEstimateData` fell through to a per-capacity default and produced a
plausible-looking estimate with no error flag.

**Exposure:** every CRGO estimate was priced from capacity defaults rather than the
real inspection, and the Clause 4.0 circle-limit check ran against those figures.
Confirmed concrete case: MSBT-15 HV coil billed at the 63 kVA default 47.00 kg instead
of the measured 10.00 kg (`totCoil` 4 × `wtOfCoil` 2.5).

**Fixed:** agency scoping moved in-memory via job IDs. Missing records now push a named
`rateError` and withhold the total instead of defaulting (F2). `agencyId` is now
stamped on new inspection saves, but **nothing filters on it until existing records are
backfilled**.

**Quantified by:** `scripts/blast-radius-console.js`.

### F2. Absent inspection data produced silent, plausible numbers

Capacity fallbacks (63 kVA HV coil 47.00, re-insulation 24.30) applied whether a field
was missing *within* a real inspection or the whole record was absent. `recordErrorIfApplies`
only checked whether the *rate* resolved, never whether the *quantity* was real.

**Fixed:** a wholly missing record now blocks with a named error. The per-field defaults
remain legitimate inside a real inspection.

### F3. CRGO scrap priced at ~4× the correct charge

Scrap was identified by `itemName` substring (`'scrap'`, `'dismental'`) plus
`itemCode === '1a'`. In the CRGO master `'1a'` is "Dismentaling" at Rs 1,603/2,061 by
capacity — the tender's labour charge, not the scrap charge. The correct charge is a
flat Rs 500 regardless of capacity.

**Exposure:** would have billed ~Rs 2,061 + AT per scrap unit instead of Rs 500 + AT.
**Confirmed non-issue in practice: 0 of 6 recovered-scrap jobs had been billed**
(`billNo`, `billSentDate`, `billAmount` all unset on AMKLL-9, KLL-6, AMSBT-1, MSBT-5,
MSBT-9, MWSBT-1). No incorrect bill reached UGVCL.

**Fixed:** resolution by mapped item code only — CRGO `'22'`, Amorphous/Wound Core
`'0'`. Correct figure: 500 × 1.04 (AT 4%) × 1.18 (GST 9+9) = 613.60 → **614**.

### F4. Scrap item code drift across three call sites

The estimate used `'19'` (defined in no master anywhere), the bill used substring
matching, and `Reports.tsx` had its own copy of the substring logic.

**Fixed:** one resolver, `resolveScrapCharge` / `getScrapItemCodeForCore` in
`lib/estimateCalc.ts`, used by the estimate, the bill and Reports. Code `'19'` retired.
Blocks with a named error when the mapped code is absent; never defaults to 500.

### F5. Scrap identity destroyed on dispatch

`job.condition` was **never written to the job document by anything** — it existed only
inside the inspection record's `data`. Scrap identity therefore lived solely in
`job.status === 'Scrap'`, which `handleDispatch` overwrites with `'Dispatched'`.

**Exposure:** a scrap transformer became indistinguishable from a repaired one the
moment it went on a challan. Confirmed: AMSBT-1, MSBT-9, MWSBT-1 (MR 85558) flipped to
"OK" after dispatch; **0 of 32 jobs registered as scrap anywhere in the database**.

**Fixed:** `InternalInspection` now writes `condition` to the job when the decision is
declared. Transitions are asymmetric by design — `unset → Scrap|Repairable` and
`Repairable → Scrap` allowed; `Scrap → Repairable` and clearing never permitted. Scrap
is a terminal determination made with the unit open: discoverable late, not
undiscoverable.

**Backfill:** `scripts/backfill-condition.js` (dry-run by default). 26 jobs writable,
6 held for manual review (internal record with an empty `condition`), 0 unrecoverable.

### F6. Guarantee clock measured from `updatedAt`

`Dashboard.tsx:292` measured the 18-month GP window from `j.dispatchDate` — a field
**nothing has ever written** — falling through to `j.updatedAt`, the last time the
record was touched for any reason.

**Exposure:** the bias is one-way. `updatedAt` only moves forward, so windows were only
ever *extended*. The error is GP work done free that could legitimately have been
charged, not valid claims wrongly rejected. The true stamp survives on every job
(`deliveryDate` / `challanDate`), so correct verdicts are recoverable.

**Fixed:** now reads `deliveryDate || challanDate`, `updatedAt` retained as last resort.
**Quantified by:** section 4 of `scripts/blast-radius-console.js`.

### F7. Earlier fixes (same class: identity or state in a field that moves)

- `inspectionStage.ts` referenced status strings no code ever sets
  (`'Ready for Testing'`, `'Testing Completed'`) instead of the real
  `'Tested - Ready for Dispatch'`.
- `InternalInspection`'s initial fetch pulled both inspection types unfiltered while
  the post-save refetch filtered correctly, so External records satisfied Internal
  completeness checks.
- Blank inspection records marked jobs complete (MR 85558).
- Saved `0` / blank values silently reloaded as `'3'` / `'4'` on HV/LV counts, and as
  the standard-table value for oil capacity.

## Recurring theme

Every entry above is one of two shapes:

1. **A silent fallback that makes missing data look like real data** — capacity
   defaults, `|| '3'`, `updatedAt` standing in for a dispatch date, a hardcoded 500.
2. **Identity stored in a mutable field** — scrap identity in `status`, transformer
   identity in a job number that is not uniquely allocated.

New code should fail loudly on missing inputs, and should never key identity to a
field that changes as the unit moves through its lifecycle.
